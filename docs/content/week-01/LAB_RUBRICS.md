| ⚠️ **Incomplete** | Missing items, needs revision |
| ❌ **Not Submitted** | No PR or working folder |

### Common Issues That Cause "Incomplete"

- ❌ Files not in `/working/` folder
- ❌ Missing README.md
- ❌ Missing PLAN.md (Labs 1+)
- ❌ No verification commands listed
- ❌ Tests not included or failing
- ❌ No "Copilot vs human" notes
- ❌ Scope creep beyond lab requirements
