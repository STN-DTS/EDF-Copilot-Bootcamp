# Lab 0 — Setup Verification + First PR

## Goal
Prove your local environment + Copilot are ready, and produce a tiny PR that follows the workflow.

## Timebox
20–30 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Complete the [Pre-Week Checklist](../PRE_WEEK_CHECKLIST.md)
- Review the [Lab Rubrics](../LAB_RUBRICS.md) for evaluation criteria

## Steps
1) Confirm Copilot works in your IDE (completion + chat).
2) Pull the training branch/repo.
3) Run build + tests (record commands used).
4) Make a tiny change (e.g., update a README line, add a small helper, fix a lint warning).
5) Use Prompt P0 (Plan only) to get a plan before changing code.
6) Commit and open a PR using the PR template checklist.

## Success Criteria
- PR opened
- Build/tests passed
- PR summary includes verification commands
