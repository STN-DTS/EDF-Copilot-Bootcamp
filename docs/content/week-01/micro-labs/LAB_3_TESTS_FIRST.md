# Lab 3 — Tests First

## Goal
Turn acceptance criteria into tests, then code. This enforces the "proof culture" where tests drive implementation.

## Timebox
60–90 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Completed Labs 0–2
- Review [Prompt Pack V1](../../../shared/reference-materials/PROMPT_PACK_V1.md) — focus on P2 (Tests-first)
- Review [Domain Context](../DOMAIN_CONTEXT.md) for business context

## Domain Context
Use the **Order Management** domain from `docs/shared/reference-materials/DOMAIN_CONTEXT.md`. Your acceptance criteria should relate to Orders, Customers, or Items entities.

### Sample Acceptance Criteria (if lead doesn't provide)
- Given an order ID, return the order with customer name and item list
- Return 404 with Problem Details if order not found
- Order total should be calculated from item prices
- Orders can be filtered by status (pending, completed, cancelled)

## Inputs
Lead provides 3–6 acceptance criteria bullets (or use samples above).

## Steps
1) Use Prompt P2 (tests-first).
2) Review the generated tests for correctness and realism.
3) Fix the tests where needed (humans own quality).
4) Implement minimal code to pass.
5) Run full test suite.

## Success Criteria
- Tests match acceptance criteria
- Minimal code change to satisfy tests
- PR includes test commands executed

## Submission (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Create Your Working Folder
```
/working/{frontend|backend}/{your_name}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMM}/
```
Example: `/working/backend/jsmith_20260121_1400/`

### Step 2: Include Required Files
- Test files (written BEFORE implementation)
- Implementation files (minimal to pass tests)
- A `README.md` containing:
  - Your name and date
  - Lab number: **Lab 3**
  - Acceptance criteria used
  - Tests generated by Copilot vs tests you fixed
  - Test commands run and results (pass/fail counts)

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request
- Use the PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Ensure all checklist items are completed
- Highlight which tests Copilot got right vs wrong

### Example Folder Structure
```
/working/backend/jsmith_20260121_1400/
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       └── OrderService.java
└── test/
    └── OrderServiceTest.java
```

> 📁 **Reference:** See `/working/frontend/example_lab3/` or `/working/backend/example_lab3/` for example submissions.

## Quick Reflection (2 min)
Before submitting, answer in your README:
- Did writing tests first change how you thought about the implementation?
- What did Copilot get wrong in the generated tests?
- How much time did you spend fixing tests vs writing code?
