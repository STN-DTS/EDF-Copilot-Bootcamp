# Daily Dev Block

**Frequency:** Daily (during Sprints 1-2)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Participants:** All developers

---

## Purpose

Quick sync on:
- **Blockers** that need immediate attention
- **Contract changes** from yesterday
- **PR review load** needing attention

---

## Format

Each person answers (30 seconds each):

1. **Blockers?** — What's stopping me?
2. **Contract impact?** — Did I encounter/propose any contract changes?
3. **PR status?** — Any PRs waiting for review?

---

## Rules

- ⏱️ **Timebox strictly** — 15 minutes max
- 🚫 **No problem-solving** — Take offline
- 📋 **Capture blockers** — Lead follows up after
- 🔄 **Contract flags** — Route to Contract Council

---

## Blocker Categories

| Type | Resolution Path |
|------|-----------------|
| **Technical** | Pair programming or async help |
| **Contract** | Contract Council topic |
| **Environment** | Lead/DevOps escalation |
| **Requirement** | Business clarification |

---

## PR Review Load Management

If PRs are piling up:
- Assign reviewers explicitly
- Consider PR review time blocks
- Reduce WIP limits

---

## When to Skip

- First 3 days of sprint (focus on planning)
- Last day of sprint (focus on demo prep)
- When team is <4 people and naturally synced
