## Ceremony Details

### Contract Council
**Purpose:** Single topic — API and domain model changes and compatibility rules.

Prevents contract drift between FE and BE teams during parallel development.

### Architecture Sync
**Purpose:** Single topic — Decisions that affect both teams.

Any decision made here that has lasting impact must become an ADR.

### Daily Dev Block
**Purpose:** Quick sync on blockers and PR load.

Keeps parallel work streams aligned without long meetings.

### PR Review Policy
**Purpose:** Consistent review standards across the team.

Ensures all PRs meet quality bar before merge.
