## Usage

These resources are referenced throughout the bootcamp:

- **Week 1:** Domain context for labs, PR review policy
- **Week 2:** Constraint register references domain
- **Week 3:** Spec incorporates domain, Architecture Sync begins
- **Week 4:** Contract based on domain, Contract Council begins
- **Sprints:** All ceremonies active, implementation uses domain

All labs and sprints should reference the shared resources to ensure consistency.
