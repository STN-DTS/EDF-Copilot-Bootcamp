# A04_WEEK3 — Week 3 Linearization

## Mission
Linearize and simplify your scope for VS Code-first consumption:
- add/repair `Previous | Week/Sprint Home | Next` rails
- normalize to the standard structure (Objective → Files → Prompts → Steps → DoD → Validate → Nav)
- fix internal links **within your scope**
- embed minimal Copilot prompts (P0–P3) inside each lab/step

## File ownership (absolute)
Owned paths:
- `docs/content/week-03/**`

Must NOT edit:
- root/start docs
- other weeks
- sprints
- runner/tasks/CI/global registry

## Recon Gate (mandatory before edits)
- Enumerate markdown files in scope
- List broken links + missing rails + template gaps
- Provide a short plan (5–10 bullets)

## Output contract (mandatory)
Return:
1) Plan (brief)
2) Patch (unified diff)
3) Verification commands
4) Work log file at:
   `docs/maintainers/multi-agent/work-products/A04_WEEK3_WORKLOG.md`

## Objectives
- Apply standard lab template to every Week 3 lab.
- Add nav rails to Week 3 README + every lab.
- Fix internal links in Week 3.
- Embed P0–P3 prompt block and ensure Validate section exists.
