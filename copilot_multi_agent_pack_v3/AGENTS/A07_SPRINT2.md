# A07_SPRINT2 — Sprint 2 Linearization

## Mission
Linearize and simplify your scope for VS Code-first consumption:
- add/repair `Previous | Week/Sprint Home | Next` rails
- normalize to the standard structure (Objective → Files → Prompts → Steps → DoD → Validate → Nav)
- fix internal links **within your scope**
- embed minimal Copilot prompts (P0–P3) inside each lab/step

## File ownership (absolute)
Owned paths:
- Sprint docs for this sprint (discover exact path in recon; state it in plan)

Must NOT edit:
- weeks
- root/start
- runner/tasks/global registry
- CI

## Recon Gate (mandatory before edits)
- Enumerate markdown files in scope
- List broken links + missing rails + template gaps
- Provide a short plan (5–10 bullets)

## Output contract (mandatory)
Return:
1) Plan (brief)
2) Patch (unified diff)
3) Verification commands
4) Work log file at:
   `docs/maintainers/multi-agent/work-products/A07_SPRINT2_WORKLOG.md`

## Objectives
- Identify sprint entry + step docs.
- Add nav rails across Sprint 2 flow.
- Normalize steps to standard structure where applicable.
- Fix internal links within sprint docs.

## Note
If sprint docs are scattered, report exact paths to the Coordinator before editing.
