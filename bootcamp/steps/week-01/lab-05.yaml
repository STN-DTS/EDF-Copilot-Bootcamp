      Generate a production-ready Dockerfile for this application:
      - Multi-stage build for smaller image
      - Non-root user for security
      - Health check instruction
      - Proper layer caching

      Generate OpenShift/Kubernetes manifests:
      - Deployment with resource limits
      - Service for internal networking
      - ConfigMap for configuration
      - Health probes (liveness, readiness)
validate:
  - Dockerfile builds without errors
  - Container runs and responds to requests
  - Kubernetes manifests are valid YAML
  - Health endpoints return correct responses
