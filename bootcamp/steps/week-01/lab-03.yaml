  - Tests written BEFORE implementation
  - Tests initially fail (red phase)
  - Implementation makes tests pass (green phase)
  - Test coverage meets minimum threshold
  - All tests passing

      I'm practicing TDD. Generate tests FIRST for [FEATURE].
      
      Requirements:
      - Unit tests for the service layer
      - Integration tests for the API endpoints
      - Edge case coverage
      - Use mocks/stubs appropriately
      
      Do NOT implement the code yet - just the tests.

      No secrets, no production data. Use placeholders.
      
      Now implement the minimal code to make all tests pass.
      Follow the patterns from the instruction files.
validate:
  - Tests exist and are well-structured
  - All tests pass
  - Implementation follows TDD principles
  - README.md documents the TDD process used
