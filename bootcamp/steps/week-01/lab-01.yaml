      I need to implement [FEATURE DESCRIPTION].
      
      Before writing any code, please provide a detailed plan:
      1. What files need to be created or modified?
      2. What are the step-by-step implementation tasks?
      3. What tests should be written?
      4. What are the potential risks or edge cases?
      5. What dependencies or prerequisites are needed?
validate:
  - PLAN.md exists with structured implementation plan
  - Plan is reviewed and approved before proceeding
  - README.md updated with lab completion notes
