## Learning Progression Implemented

| Lab | Core Concept | 🔙 Builds On | 🔜 Leads To |
|-----|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Lab 0 | Setup + First PR | Prior development experience (entry point) | Lab 1: Plan-first discipline |
| Lab 1 | Plan-Only (P0 mandate) | Lab 0 environment & PR workflow | Lab 2: Scaffold execution |
| Lab 2 | Vertical Slice Scaffold | Lab 1 planning skills | Lab 3: TDD verification |
| Lab 3 | TDD / Tests First | Lab 2 scaffold | Lab 4: Safe refactoring |
| Lab 4 | Refactor Guarded | Lab 3 test coverage | Lab 5: Deployment readiness |
| Lab 5 | OpenShift Readiness | Lab 4 clean code | Lab 6: Full feature integration |
| Lab 6 | Capstone Mini-Feature | All prior labs (0-5) | Week 2 constraints + Sprint work |

## Section Placement

### 🔙 Building On (Tie-Back)
- **Location:** After "Goal" section, before "Timebox"
- **Purpose:** Connect current lab to prerequisite skills from previous labs
- **Format:** Horizontal rule, section header, context paragraph, key connection callout, horizontal rule

### 🔜 Looking Ahead (Tie-Forward)
- **Location:** After final content section (Quick Reflection or Week 1 Completion Checklist), before "Navigation"
- **Purpose:** Preview skills needed in the next lab and show the learning trajectory
- **Format:** Horizontal rule, section header, preview paragraph, next skill callout, horizontal rule

## Content Summary

### Lab 0 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Entry point connecting existing dev skills to AI augmentation
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Introduces P0 plan-first discipline in Lab 1

### Lab 1 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** References Lab 0 environment/PR workflow, adds mandatory planning step
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Plan becomes blueprint for Lab 2 scaffold execution

### Lab 2 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Uses P0 pattern from Lab 1 but now executes on the plan
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Scaffold provides something concrete to test in Lab 3

### Lab 3 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Scaffold from Lab 2 gives something to test; tests verify AI code
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Tests become safety net for Lab 4 refactoring

### Lab 4 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Lab 3 tests enable confident refactoring
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Clean, tested code ready for Lab 5 deployment

### Lab 5 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Clean code from Labs 3-4 easier to containerize
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** All skills integrate in Lab 6 capstone

### Lab 6 Tie-Backs
- **🔙 Building On:** Complete workflow: plan → scaffold → test → refactor → deploy
- **🔜 Looking Ahead:** Week 2 constraints + Sprint 1 real feature work
