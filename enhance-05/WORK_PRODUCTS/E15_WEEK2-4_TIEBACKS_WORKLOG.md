## Agent: E15_WEEK2-4_TIEBACKS
## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Mission
Verify Week 2-4 lab YAML files have proper tie-back/tie-forward sections.

## Analysis
All 12 Week 2-4 labs examined:
- bootcamp/steps/week-02/lab-00.yaml through lab-03.yaml
- bootcamp/steps/week-03/lab-00.yaml through lab-03.yaml
- bootcamp/steps/week-04/lab-00.yaml through lab-03.yaml

## Findings
1. **Navigation Chain**: ✅ Complete chain from week-01-lab-06 through week-04-lab-03 to sprint-01-step-00
2. **Prerequisites Sections**: Added to 10 files linking to Week 1 skills
3. **Read Sections**: Expanded with foundational materials
4. **Comments**: Inline YAML comments documenting tie-backs

## Tie-Back Pattern
```yaml
prerequisites:
  - week-01-lab-XX  # Explicit skill dependency
read:
  - docs/shared/reference-materials/PROMPT_PACK_V1.md
  - docs/shared/reference-materials/DOMAIN_CONTEXT.md
  # Week 1 tie-back: Planning patterns
```
