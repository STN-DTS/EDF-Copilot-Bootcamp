## Summary

Verified and enhanced Week 2-4 lab YAML files with proper tie-back/tie-forward sections.

### Navigation Chain Verification

| Lab | nav.prev | nav.next | Status |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| week-02-lab-00 | week-01-lab-06 | week-02-lab-01 | ✅ |
| week-02-lab-01 | week-02-lab-00 | week-02-lab-02 | ✅ |
| week-02-lab-02 | week-02-lab-01 | week-02-lab-03 | ✅ |
| week-02-lab-03 | week-02-lab-02 | week-03-lab-00 | ✅ |
| week-03-lab-00 | week-02-lab-03 | week-03-lab-01 | ✅ |
| week-03-lab-01 | week-03-lab-00 | week-03-lab-02 | ✅ |
| week-03-lab-02 | week-03-lab-01 | week-03-lab-03 | ✅ |
| week-03-lab-03 | week-03-lab-02 | week-04-lab-00 | ✅ |
| week-04-lab-00 | week-03-lab-03 | week-04-lab-01 | ✅ |
| week-04-lab-01 | week-04-lab-00 | week-04-lab-02 | ✅ |
| week-04-lab-02 | week-04-lab-01 | week-04-lab-03 | ✅ |
| week-04-lab-03 | week-04-lab-02 | sprint-01-step-00 | ✅ |

**Result:** Full navigation chain intact from Week 1 → Week 4 → Sprint 1

### Enhancements Applied

Added to 10 YAML files:

1. **`prerequisites:` section** - Links each lab to required Week 1 skills
2. **Expanded `read:` sections** - Added Week 1 reference materials
3. **YAML comments** - Documented tie-back purpose inline
